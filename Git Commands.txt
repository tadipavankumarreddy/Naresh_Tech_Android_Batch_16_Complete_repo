Git 
- Source code management (SCM) and Version Control Software
- This is the "Distributed Version Control System"

Version Control Systems
- Centralized version control System
- Distributed Version Control system

Disadvantages of CVCS:
- If the server crashes for some reason -> all your work is gone
- If there is no internet connectivity -> You carryout the task

Advantages of DVCS:
- There is no dependency with the internet as we can work with the existing project on the local syste,
- Even when the server crashes, the code is still available on the local systems

What is the need of Source code management and Version Control?
In software development process, there are many stake holders working simultaneously.

How to initialize a project ?
1. you can start with a existing code
2. You can start afresh

- git init
This command initializes the git project with which we get an invisible folder ".git"

How do we check if files are tracked by git or added to git ?
- git status

How to move a file(s) to staging area ?
- git add <file name1> <file name2>

How do we move the file(s) in the staging area to Repository ?
- git commit -m "Reason for making the commit"

What comes with a commit ?
- Every commit will have 40 bit character length SHA(Secure hash algorithm) key
- With the help of his hash key we can roll the project back to this state anytime in the future.

How do we check the number of commits that are made in the project ?
- git log
- git log --oneline
- git log --reverse 

How do we roll the project back to version 1 ?
- git checkout <Commit Id (first 7 characters are sufficient>
